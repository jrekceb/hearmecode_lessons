# Difficulty Level: Intermediate

# Goal: Create a program that prints out an HTML drop down menu for all 50 states

# Step 1: Define your list of states
# These should all be strings, since they're names of places
# Instead of having to type them all out, I really like liststates.com -- you can even customize the format it gives you the states in to make it super easy to copy/paste into your code here
state_abbreviation = ["AK","AL","AR","AZ","CA","CO","CT","DC","DE","FL","GA","HI","IA","ID","IL","IN","KS","KY","LA","MA","MD","ME","MI","MN","MO","MS","MT","NC","ND","NE","NH","NJ","NM","NV","NY","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI","SC","SD","TN","TX","UT","VA","VT","WA","WI","WV","WY"]
full_state_name = ["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","District Of Columbia","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Carolina","North Dakota","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming"]

print "<select>=full_state_name\n"

for i in range(1,len(full_state_name)):
		print "\t<option value=\"{0}\">{1}</option>\n".format(state_abbreviation[i],full_state_name[i])

print "<select>\n"

# </select>)
# Step 2: Create your loop
# Essentially, you're telling Python: for each state in my list: print this HTML code
# A good place to start is by printing the name of the state in the loop; after that you can add the HTML around it

# Step 3: Add the HTML
# A drop-down menu in HTML looks like this:

# <select>
# 			<option value="state_abbreviation">Full state name</option>
# </select>

# At line 14, we create the drop-down menu
# At line 15, we create one drop-down item.  Each additional <option> that we add will add another item to our drop-down menu
# At line 16, we tell HTML that we're done with the drop-down menu

# Step 4: Test it!
# Have Python print out the HTML code. Copy / paste it into a file, save that file as "states.html" and open that file in a web browser.
# Later, when we learn file handling, we can skip the copy/paste step.
# File handling can also let us create a file with the state names and abbrev
